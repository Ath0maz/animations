<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

   <p>
   At first, I was not quite understanding the logic of animations with Daer, and I felt a little difficulty about it.<br>
   But during the tests, transitions, everything was getting better in my mind, I started to understand well, and finishing the application with few problems and difficulties.<br>
   I had an error in the middle of the path that cost me a long time, and it was that the animation only received values in rgb, and not in hexadecimal, which was the form I was using, and I spent hours trying to solve this simple problem, but there was even more learning about these kinds problems.<br>
   And that is the secret, to learn from our mistakes and the mistakes of others, so that they do not happen to us.
